# Learning SwiftUI Day 11 Summary


1. Protocols describe what methods and properties a conforming type must have, but donâ€™t provide the implementations of those methods.
2. We can build protocols on top of other protocols, similar to classes.
3. Extensions let us add methods and computed properties to specific types such as Int.
4. Protocol extensions let us add methods and computed properties to protocols.
5. Protocol-oriented programming is the practice of designing our app architecture as a series of protocols, then using protocol extensions to provide default method implementations.
