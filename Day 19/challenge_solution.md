# LengthConverter

We are going to build an app - LengthConverter that converts the length from one unit to another unit, and both the input and output input length type can be chosen by user.

So basic overview of what we'll have in our app:
1. A navigation title having name of our app.
2. A picker asking the user which unit are they entering the value.
3. A textField asking the user to enter that value.
4. A picker asking the user to select the output unit.
5. Showing user the value asked in the output unit.
